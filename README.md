# Simon

The Simon game is the exciting electronic game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order. It's fast-paced play, with lights and sounds that can challenge you. Experience the fun as you repeat the patterns and advance to higher levels. Keep track of your score as you challenge friends or try to beat your own high score.

Give the example

I press start game, the program flashes one color, I click that color. The computer flashes the same color  and a new additional color. I click those two then the computer will flash 3 colors and so on...
